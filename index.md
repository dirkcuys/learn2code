In this tutorial you will learn basic coding principles in a visually satisfying way (I hope). You will create something of interest while learning to code. That something of interest will be a side scrolling city skyline and you'll get there in less than 8 hours, promise, you can get your money back if you don't. 

We will be using JavaScript - a programming language that runs in your browser. And everything we do will be online, where code feels most at home.

Also, there will be stuff you may not understand (most notably below the line "Stuff you don't need to understand" (you will know it when you see it)). Don't be scared, I've been doing this for more than 10 years and I still see lots of stuff I don't understand, I just blame it on other people writing ununderstandable code.
